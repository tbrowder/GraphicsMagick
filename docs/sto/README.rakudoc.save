=head1 NAME

B<GraphicsMagick> - Provides programs and functions for manipulating images

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use GraphicsMagick;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<GraphicsMagickUtils> Uses the L<http://graphicsmagick.org> suite of tools to
provide command-line (CL) programs and functions for manipulating images programmatically.

Your host computer B<must> have the GraphicsMagic package, with its C<gm> CL program already installed.

To install that package on a Debian host:

=begin code
$ sudo aptitude install graphicsmagick
=end code

=head2 CL Programs

=head3 B<photo> NYI

A program designed for
processing images for display on a website. 
The program uses the I<graphicsmagick>'s command-line program I<gm> and
some of its myriad of commands and options, all driven by Raku's I<run> routine.

Its default action, given the name of
an image file, is to determine and display:

=item The width and height of the image
=item The coordinates of the image's center

The following tables show the currently planned
modes and options and their implementation status.

=begin table :caption<Modes>
Mode | Implemented? | Notes
-----+--------------+------
show | Yes          |
show all | Yes
prep | No | shows input data
crop | No | shows input data
display | No | Requires an X window
=end table

=begin table :caption<Options>
Optiom | Implemented? | Notes
-----+--------------+------
color | Yes
border | Yes
debug | Yes |
=end table

Other planned features:

=item Determine the best contrasting color for overlays 

Then the program will overlay the image atop a white background with:

=item An 'x' at the center

=item A 100-pixel square border around the center

=item A '+' at each corner of the image

=item The coordinates of the center and each corner

=item The name of the new image

=item The new image's attributes 

The user can then view the converted image to fine-tune the desired center point
of the 100-pixel border by rerunning the program with the desired X,Y coordinates
entered with the C<center=X,Y> option and inspect those results, repeating as necessary,
and possibly adding more options, until satisfied with the results.

At that point, the user can rerun the program and add the C<exec> mode to the CL to
produce the desired cropped image with no overlays. The output image file, by default,
will be named C<image.ctr-100-pix-square>, but may be changed by use of
option C<output=filename>.

=head2 Planned features

=item Add more options to C<crop>

=item Add more GM programs for other major image transformations or conversions

=item Save the last set of options used for each program and show them when arguments
are entered. Then, if satisfied with the results, enter the image name with the C<<program>> mode
to get the resulting transformed image.

=head1 NAME

B<GraphicsMagick> - Provides programs and functions for manipulating images

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use GraphicsMagick;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<GraphicsMagick> Uses the L<http://graphicsmagick.org> suite of
tools to provide command-line (CL) programs and functions for
manipulating images programmatically.

Your host computer B<must> have the GraphicsMagick package, with its
C<gm> CLI program already installed. For some features it also
requires the GTK3 library.

To install those packages on a Debian host:

=begin code
$ sudo aptitude install graphicsmagick
$ sudo aptitude install libgtk-3-dev
=end code

For a MacOS host

=begin code
brew update
brew install graphicsmagick gtk+3
=end code

=head2 CLI Programs

=head3 B<photo>

A program designed for processing images for display on a website.
The program uses the I<graphicsmagick>'s command-line program I<gm>
and some of its myriad of commands and options, all driven by Raku's
I<run> routine.

Its default action, given the name of
an image file, is to determine and display:

=item The width and height of the image and its creation time

The following tables show the currently planned modes and options and
their implementation status.

=begin table :caption<Modes>
Mode     | Implemented? | Notes
---------+--------------+------
show     | Yes          |
show all | Yes          | shows all known attributes
*crop    | No           | shows input data
execute  | No           | No X display required
display  | No           | Requires an X window
=end table

*Note: If an X display is available, the C<crop> mode will also
display the original image with an overlay of the crop selection.

=begin table :caption<Options>
Option | Implemented? | Notes
-----+--------------+------
color | Yes | value is set
border | Yes | value is set
to-dir  | Yes | value is set
name | Yes | value is set
force | Yes |
debug | Yes |
=end table

Other features are planned, PRs and feature requests are
welcome.

Execute program C<photo> with the C<help> option to see how
to use it:

=begin code
$ photo help

Usage: photo image [mode] [options...][help]

This program uses the 'GraphicsMagick' library to manipulate
an image for use on a photo montage website or a photo album.

It can crop an image to a default 100x100 size about a selected
point. Dimensions and points are given in pixels: X=width,
Y=height.  The coordinate system used has its origin at the
top-left corner of the image with positive values increasing to
the right and down.

Output images are written to the local directory unless the
'to-dir=X' option is used.

Modes:
  display      - With an X display, shows the raw image
  show         - Shows primary image attributes
  show all     - Shows all available attibutes
  crop=WxH+X+Y - Crops the image to WxH pixels centered at X and
                 Y of the image. If the width and height are not
                 specified, they default to 100 pixels. If the X
                 and Y are not specified, they default to the
                 center of the image. If one of either pair of
                 values are specified, it is assumed to be the
                 value of both. If only one value is entered,
                 all four arguments take that value.

                 If an X display is available, shows a copy of
                 the original with a border superimposed upon
                 the selected crop area of the picture.
  execute      - Executes the crop to produce a new image with
                 the current set of crop parameters

Options:
  color=X    - Changes the border color to X [default: white]
  border=X   - Changes the border with to X pixels [default: 2]
  to-dir=X   - Output directory [default: '.']
  name=X     - Output image name [default: '$image.mod']
  debug      - Developer use

=end code

Note 14 photos of human faces are available in the C<resources/images>
directory of the distribution. They were all obtained from the Debian
C</use/share> directory and are free to use for any purpose.  They are
useful for experimenting with this module and its programs.

=head2 ToDo

=item Add capability to run on MacOS and Windows
=item Add tests
=item Add more GM functions
=item Add sample pictures and transformed results

In addition to those listed above, you can specify these standard X
resources as command line options:  -background, -bordercolor,
-borderwidth, -font, -foreground, -iconGeometry, -iconic, -mattecolor,
-name, -shared-memory, -usePixmap, or -title.

By default, the image format of `file' is determined by its magic
number.  To specify a particular image format, precede the filename
with an image format name and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the
image type as the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  Specify 'file' as
'-' for standard input or output.
